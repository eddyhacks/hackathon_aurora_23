            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace, with a
                rising number of data breaches each year. A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9
                billion records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure
                is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018.

                Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious criminals
                responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to cybercriminals because they
                collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that use networks can be targeted for customer
                data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.

                With the scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise, the International Data Corporation predicts
                that worldwide spending on cyber-security solutions will reach a massive $133.7 billion by 2022.
                Governments across the globe have responded to the rising cyber threat with guidance to help
                organizations implement effective cyber-security practices.

                In the U.S., the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a cyber-security
                framework. To combat the proliferation of malicious code and aid in early detection, the framework
                recommends continuous, real-time monitoring of all electronic resources.
